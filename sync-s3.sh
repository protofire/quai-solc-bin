# Uploads the content of the local working copy to a storage bucket on
# Amazon S3. Removes any files that do not exist locally. Files in the root
# directory with names starting with a dot or an underscore are not uploaded.
#
# The script assumes that the AWS CLI tool is installed and already configured
# with credentials allowing it to modify the bucket.
#
# NOTE: There's no built-in mechanism for updating an S3 bucket in an atomic
# way. Only individual file updates are atomic. This means that during the
# sync clients will see the intermediate state with some files missing or not
# yet updated. Since the binaries are never modified or removed from the repository
# under normal circumstances, updating file lists last is enough to alleviate this.
#
# When running multiple instances of this script concurrently on different
# revisions it's theoretically possible to end up with any combination of
# their files in the bucket so it should be avoided.
#
# WARNING: The script destructively modifies the working copy. Always run it
# on a fresh clone!
